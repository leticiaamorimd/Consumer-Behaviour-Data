The data has been collected over time from their various branches to understand consumer behaviour in the different regions of the
country. 

## User stories: 

1. As a user, I want to know the most and least sold products per branch
2. As a user, I want to know the best perfoming branches. 
3. As a user, I want to know the per hour sales for the top branches. 
4. As a user, I want to know the most profitable branches.
